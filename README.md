# Manual-implementation-of-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
Manually implement Stochastic Gradient Descent and perform Linear Regression on Boston housing data and compare with sklearn's implementation of Linear Regression.

## Data
We used data from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html">sklearn datasets</a>

## Metric
We used Root Mean Squared Error as the evaluation metric here.
